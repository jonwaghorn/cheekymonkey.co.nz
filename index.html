      <h1>Cheeky Monkey</h1>
      <p>I'm a software/web developer type person. I have worked independently in the past but I'm currently working for <a href="http://3months.com">3months.com</a>. They're a great bunch of folks and if you're looking to get a web site built you should definitely talk to them.</p>
      <p>Some personal sites I've developed and continue to support in my spare (right!) time:</p>
      <p><a href="http://tracks.org.nz">Tracks</a> (tracks.org.nz)</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.blueandwhite.co.nz">Collecting antique British blue and white china in New Zealand</a> (blueandwhite.co.nz, a family project)</p>
